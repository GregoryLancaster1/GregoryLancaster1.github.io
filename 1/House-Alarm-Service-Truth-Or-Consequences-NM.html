<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they may be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people may find out to be cautious about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
