<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
