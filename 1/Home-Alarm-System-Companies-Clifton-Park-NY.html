<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
