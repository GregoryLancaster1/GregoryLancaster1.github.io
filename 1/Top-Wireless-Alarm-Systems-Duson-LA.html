<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and utilize 2 AA batteries that can last up to two years. Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
