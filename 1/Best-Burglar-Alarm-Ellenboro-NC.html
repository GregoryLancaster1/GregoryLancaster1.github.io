<p>A lot of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to search archived video footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several places. Typically, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more identified burglars. They might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
