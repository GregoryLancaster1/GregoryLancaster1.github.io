As just recently as 10 years earlier, consumers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems altered that.

And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the first year.
