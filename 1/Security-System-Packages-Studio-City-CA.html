<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that clearly stands out to alert burglars that your home is under surveillance.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
