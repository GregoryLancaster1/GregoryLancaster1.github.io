<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge. Due to the fact that it comes with several door and window sensors for full coverage, we recommend the eight-piece package. We also recommend including a doorbell video camera at some time.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.
