<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
