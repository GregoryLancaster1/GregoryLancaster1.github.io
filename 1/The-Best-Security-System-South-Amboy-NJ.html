With a wireless system, you can also get push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is an issue, even when you're not at home.</p>

There's no latency so you get notified instantly so you can take instant actions such as setting off a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the possible burglars.</p>
