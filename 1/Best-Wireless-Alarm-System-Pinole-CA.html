<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
