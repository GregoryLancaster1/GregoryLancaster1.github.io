<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
