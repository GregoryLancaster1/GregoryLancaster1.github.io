<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced clever home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Worth keeping in mind: you can also get an outdoor variation (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is basically the exact same but with a range added features. This one switches and has a motion-sensor on a light and siren which may be a good deterrent to intruders, plus it's obviously water resistant and has a longer cable television. Otherwise, exact same principle, same app, still just as simple. to setup. And you don't need to worry about its battery life. Typically, the battery could last for 4 to 6 months per charge.
