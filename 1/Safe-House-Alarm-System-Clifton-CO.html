<p>While every homeowner stresses over burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a totally free mobile phone app that permits citizens who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety officials.
