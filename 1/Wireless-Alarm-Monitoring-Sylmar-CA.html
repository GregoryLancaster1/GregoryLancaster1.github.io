<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  method to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
