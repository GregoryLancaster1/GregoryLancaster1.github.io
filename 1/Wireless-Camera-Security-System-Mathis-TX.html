It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will lower criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

If you have old hardwired devices, you can user interface them with a wireless panel by including a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>
