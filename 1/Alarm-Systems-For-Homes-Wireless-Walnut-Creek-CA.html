We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR.
