Just believe how much info you give away when you do a simple online grocery order: your name, your address, the example you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You may even give directions on how to enter into your building. As recently as 10 years earlier, consumers did not have access to innovation that let them manage their own home security systems.
