<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to control practically every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's extremely personalized.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary advantages like individual detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 monthly.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about 50 percent of the camera and the time consistently disconnected from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>

For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture details as 1080p.
