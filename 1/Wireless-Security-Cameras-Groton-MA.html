Ring's app uses a variety of settings, such as custom-made motion zones, scheduling and more. Contribute to that Ring's neighborhood-watch feature, which lets you see what's happening in your area from other Ring users, as well as from your local cops and fire departments.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like bright sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific circumstances such as baby-sitter web cams or signing in on a pet, though when wanting to collect proof of a criminal offense they often lose.</p>
