<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
