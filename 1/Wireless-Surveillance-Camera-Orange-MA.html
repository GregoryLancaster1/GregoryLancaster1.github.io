You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
