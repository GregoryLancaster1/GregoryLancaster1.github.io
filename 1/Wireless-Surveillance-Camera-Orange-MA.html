You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However given that the majority of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some additional money while offering a consumer change, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
