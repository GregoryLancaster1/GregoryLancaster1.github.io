<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the debate over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a debate that's frequently manipulated by factors such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and glitches that cause incorrect alarms. While improvements in the last few years have made the innovation more robust and popular (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses appointed to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more competence to setup, and normally cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensors interact with a control panel.
