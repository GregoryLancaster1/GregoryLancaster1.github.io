<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand out too much. Pretty easy to install.

The second important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill inbuilt alarm, so it operates as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera. That distinguishes it from the products I have actually already written, and assists in part to describe its cost.</p>

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve.
