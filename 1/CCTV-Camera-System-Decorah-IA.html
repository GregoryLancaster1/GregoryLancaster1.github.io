<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
