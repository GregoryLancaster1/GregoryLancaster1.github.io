More recently, decentralized IP cameras, maybe equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording straight to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
