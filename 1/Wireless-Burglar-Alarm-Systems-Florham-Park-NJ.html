<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor.

Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
