As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members."
