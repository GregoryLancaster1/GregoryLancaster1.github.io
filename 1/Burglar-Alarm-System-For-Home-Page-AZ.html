<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Excellent ranking for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.
