Both the original Abode system and the Home Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we evaluated that likewise deals with HomeKit.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
