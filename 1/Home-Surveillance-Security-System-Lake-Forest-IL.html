<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>No false alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Because the house owner is in charge of the system, authorities are only contacted if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will get in touch with cops if a homeowner can't validate a false alarm. If  cops are contacted for an incorrect alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
