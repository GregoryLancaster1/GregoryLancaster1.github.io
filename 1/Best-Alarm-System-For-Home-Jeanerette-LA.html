"As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the general down pattern in criminal activities and offences," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually reduced crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
