The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive enemy to tape these codes and use different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
