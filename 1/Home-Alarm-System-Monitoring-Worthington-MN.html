They use versatility in their equipment and readily available plans, allowing house owners to choose the security solution that best suits their requirements.

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
