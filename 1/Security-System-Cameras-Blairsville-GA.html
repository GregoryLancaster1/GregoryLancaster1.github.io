<p>The loudest of the smart alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at warning anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's a problem. Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for animals, too. The alarm system is simply one of 2 we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're satisfied that it also features a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from trying to break in to your property. We checked Somfy's more costly system, which came with a wifi security camera, however more cost effective kits are also offered. Regardless of the significant cost here, there's no external monitoring option.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
