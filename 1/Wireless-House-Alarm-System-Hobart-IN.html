The alarm permit holder will be billed by the police department in the quantity of $50.00 for any action to an alarm system which is not excepted (see 3rd bullet point) after the 12th alarm.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>Brinks has quite standard equipment, however we like its clever monitoring notifies.
