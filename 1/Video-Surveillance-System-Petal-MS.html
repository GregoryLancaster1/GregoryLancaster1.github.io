When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
