<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it found any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the issue.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
