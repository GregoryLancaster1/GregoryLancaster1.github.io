CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by altering a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
