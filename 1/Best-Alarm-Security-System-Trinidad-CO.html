Without being able to see a visual verification, you will either have to hurry back home only to find a false alarm or you'll need to call your next-door neighbors, good friends, or household to sign in.</p>

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
