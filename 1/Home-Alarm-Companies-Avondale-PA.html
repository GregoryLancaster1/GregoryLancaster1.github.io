<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
