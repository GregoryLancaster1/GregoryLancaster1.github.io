However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about half of the camera and the time routinely detached from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).

Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt.
