It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store footage locally on an SD card.

<p>A security company will make more cash if you go with a professionally set up system. Normally, in this circumstances, a security company will oftentimes offer you the equipment for free and supply you with a free installation.
