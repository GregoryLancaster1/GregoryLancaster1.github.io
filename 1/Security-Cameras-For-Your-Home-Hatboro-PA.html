<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we may review this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.
