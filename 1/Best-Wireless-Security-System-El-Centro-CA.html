<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.
