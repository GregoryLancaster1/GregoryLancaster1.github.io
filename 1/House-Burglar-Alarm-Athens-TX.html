<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
