<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they might be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might find out to be mindful about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>

When you include other Ring items to Call Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can provide live video streaming, two-way interaction, and smart lighting.
