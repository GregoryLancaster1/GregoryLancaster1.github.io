<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and for how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
