You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System in Missouri</h3>

Here is what this suggests, by method of an example.

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
