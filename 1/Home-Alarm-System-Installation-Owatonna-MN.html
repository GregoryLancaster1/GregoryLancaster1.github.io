No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
