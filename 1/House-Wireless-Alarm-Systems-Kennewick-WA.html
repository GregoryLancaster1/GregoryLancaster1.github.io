<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to theft decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
