<h2>Latest Projects Based On Wireless Camera Madison</h2>
<p>Think about it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be cost the low price of forty dollars?

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
