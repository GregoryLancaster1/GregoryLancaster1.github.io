<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from preventing lawbreakers. Due to the fact that the dome housing makes it really difficult for people to see which direction the camera is pointing, this is. This develops an air of uncertainty for potential thieves or vandals approaching from all instructions. , if those circumstances sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive provide some flexibility on monitoring agreement length if you buy equipment up front..
