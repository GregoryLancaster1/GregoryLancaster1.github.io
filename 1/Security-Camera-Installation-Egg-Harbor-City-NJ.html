<p>Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless means the camera is wire-free.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
