<p>While every property owner frets about break-ins, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a free mobile phone app that allows residents who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety authorities. For example, a public transit rider might discover someone acting suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile devices.
